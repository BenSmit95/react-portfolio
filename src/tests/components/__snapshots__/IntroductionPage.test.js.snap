      About me:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hey there! My name is Benjamin, and I'm a self taught web developer based in Katwijk, ZH. My skills mainly lie in front-end development, where I use technologies like React and Sass to make interesting web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always learning more though! Right now I'm focusing on learning more about backend technologies, like Node and Express. I don't like sitting still and am always looking for the next challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why I am looking for a junior position at a web development company, where I can push my limits and develop my skills. My contact info is on THIS page.
